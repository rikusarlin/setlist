# Setlist app
This is a hobby project for bands needing to create setlists and showing the notes of the pieces in setlist.

Still a work very much in progress, sorry...

In some not so distant future, the aim is to provide more functionality:
- possibility to transpose the pieces according to singers' whims
- basic editing of chords in the pieces (and their positions)

It is assumed that pieces are represented in text files in the following style:

Knockin On Heavens Door chords by Bob Dylan
[Intro]
G D Am
G D C
 
[Verse]
G              D            Am
Mama take this badge off of me
G       D         C
I can't use it anymore
G            D                        Am
It's getting dark, too dark to see
G          D                   C
I feel I'm knockin on heaven's door
 
[Chorus]
G             D                    Am
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    Am
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
```
